  </ul>

  <h3>International Restrictions</h3>
  <p>
    In international business, there is a fear of the restrictions which are imposed by the government of the different countries. Many country’s governments don’t allow international businesses in their country. They have trade blocks, tariff barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, etc. These things are harmful to international business.
  </p>

  <h3>Benefits To Participating Countries</h3>
  <p>
    It gives benefits to the countries which are participating in the international business. The richer or developed countries grow their business to the global level and they get maximum benefits. The developing countries get the latest technology, foreign capital, employment opportunities, rapid industrial development, etc. This helps developing countries in developing their economy. Therefore, developing countries open up their economy for foreign investments.
  </p>

  <h3>Large Scale Operations</h3>
  <p>
    International business contains a large number of operations at a time because it is conducted on a large scale globally. Production of the goods at a large scale, they have to fulfil the demand at a global level. Marketing of the product is also conducted at a large scale to make them aware of the product. First, they fulfil the domestic demand and then they export the surplus in the foreign markets.
  </p>

  <h3>Integration Of Economies</h3>
  <p>
    International Business combines the economies of many countries. The companies use the finance, labour, resources, and infrastructure of the other countries in which they are working. They produce the parts in different countries, assemble the product in other countries and sell their product in other countries.
  </p>

  <h3>Dominated By Developed Countries</h3>
  <p>
    International business is dominated by developed countries and their MNC’s. Countries like U.S.A, Europe, and Japan all are the countries that are producing high-quality products, they have people working for them on high salaries. They have large financial and other resources like the best technology and Research and Development centers. Therefore, they produce good quality products and services at low prices. They help them to capture the world market.
  </p>

  <h3>Market Segmentation</h3>
  <p>
    International business is based on market segmentation on the basis of the geographic segmentation of the consumers. The market is divided into different groups according to the demand of the consumers in different countries. It produces goods according to the demand of the consumers of the different market segmentations.
  </p>

  <h3>Sensitive Nature</h3>
  <p>
    International Business is highly affected by economic policies, political environment, technology, etc. It can play a positive role to improve the business and can also be negative for the business. It totally depends on the policies made by the government, it can help in expanding the business and maximizing the profits and vice-versa.
  </p>
 <h1>Scope of IB</h1>
  <h2>Foreign Investments</h2>
  <p>
    Foreign investment is an important part of international business. Foreign investment contains
    investments of funds from abroad in exchange for financial return. Foreign investment is
    done through investment in foreign countries through international business. Foreign
    investments are two types which are direct investment and portfolio investment.
  </p>

  <h2>Exports And Imports Of Merchandise</h2>
  <p>
    Merchandise are the goods which are tangible (those goods which can be seen and touched).
    As mentioned above, merchandise export means sending the home country’s goods to other
    countries which are tangible, and merchandise imports means bringing tangible goods to the
    home country.
  </p>

  <h2>Licensing And Franchising</h2>
  <p>
    Franchising means giving permission to the new party of the foreign country in order to
    produce and sell goods under your trademarks, patents or copyrights in exchange for some fee,
    which is also a way to enter into international business. Licensing system refers to the companies
    like Pepsi and Coca-Cola which are produced and sold by local bottlers in foreign countries.
  </p>

  <h2>Service Exports And Imports</h2>
  <p>
    Service exports and imports consist of the intangible items which cannot be seen and touched.
    The trade between the countries of the services is also known as invisible trade. There is a
    variety of services like tourism, travel, boarding, lodging, constructing, training, educational,
    financial services, etc. Tourism and travel are major components of world trade in services.
  </p>

  <h2>Growth Opportunities</h2>
  <p>
    There are lots of growth opportunities for both countries, developing and underdeveloped countries, by trading with each other at a global level. The imports and exports of
    the countries grow their profits and help them to grow at a global level.
  </p>

  <h2>Benefiting From Currency Exchange</h2>
  <p>
    International business also plays an important role while the currency exchange rate, as one can
    take advantage of the currency fluctuations. For example, when the U.S. dollar is down, you
    might be able to export more as foreign customers benefit from the favorable currency
    exchange rate.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitations Of The Domestic Market</h2>
  <p>
    If the domestic market of a country is small, then international business is a good option for
    the growth of the business in the host country. Depression of domestic market firms will
    force to explore foreign markets.
  </p>

  <h1>Importance of International Business</h1>
  <h2>Market Expansion</h2>
  <p>
    International businesses are opened to perform business in different countries across the globe.
    These businesses keep on expanding their activities and explore new markets for selling more and
    more products. The international business earns a high amount of profits which helps them in
    expanding their market share.
  </p>

  <h2>Brings Foreign Exchange</h2>
  <p>
    The international business earns a large amount of foreign exchange by selling its products
    among different countries. All payments are received in terms of foreign currency which are
    used by its home country for payment of imports. The foreign exchange earned by these
    businesses helps in the overall economic development of the country.
  </p>

  <h2>Spreading Of Business Risks</h2>
  <p>
    Presence of international businesses around the globe helps in spreading its risk. In case,
    if there is a loss incurred by this business in any one of the countries then that can be easily
    adjusted with the profit earned in other countries. International business transfers their
    surplus goods or resources in one country to another country which helps them in reducing
    their risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Economies Of Scale</h2>
  <p>
    These businesses are able to enjoy economies of scale due to their large-scale production.
    International businesses produce a large amount of goods for selling in different countries. With
    the increase in the amount of production, the per unit cost of producing goods goes down which helps
    them in earning large profits.
  </p>

  <h2>Cost Advantage</h2>
  <p>
    International business takes cost advantage over its competitors by producing goods in one
    country and exporting them to another country. They carry on their production in a country
    where factors of production are easily and cheaply available. This helps in minimizing the cost
    of the product and earn huge profits by selling them at better prices in other countries.
  </p>

  <h2>Improves International Relations</h2>
  <p>
    International business helps in strengthening the economic relations among nations. These
    businesses help other nations by exporting goods of their requirements. It helps in
    developing better mutual understanding among countries due to which they are ready to support
    each other in times of need.
  </p>

  <h2>Provide Employment Opportunities</h2>
  <p>
    International business employs a large number of people for carrying out its operations across
    the globe. They perform large-scale operations in many countries for which they require a large
    amount of human resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Government Support</h2>
  <p>
    These businesses also enjoy government support for carrying out their operations and
    expanding their size. The government provides tax and financial benefits to these businesses
    as they earn a large amount of foreign reserves for the country.

  <h2>COMPONENTS OF GLOBALISATION</h2>

  <h3>GLOBALIZATION OF MARKETS:</h3>
  <p>Globalization of markets refers to the process of integrating and merging of the distinct world markets into a single
    market</p>
  <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's burgers, Levi's Jeans etc.</p>
  <h4>FEATURES:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Size of the company need not be too large</li>
    <li>Distinction of national markets still prevail</li>
    <li>Most of the foreign markets are markets for non-consumer goods</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>REASONS FOR GLOBALIZATION OF MARKETS</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Large-scale industrialization enabled mass production</li>
    <li>Risk reduction by diversification</li>
    <li>Increase profits and achieve goals</li>
    <li>Adverse business environment in home country</li>
    <li>Demand for their products in foreign markets</li>
    <li>Failure of domestic companies to cater to the needs of customers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>GLOBALIZATION OF PRODUCTION</h3>
  <p>Globalization of production is locating the manufacturing facilities in a number of locations around the globe.</p>
  <h4>REASONS:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Impositions of imports by the foreign country</li>
    <li>Availability of high-quality raw materials and components</li>
    <li>Availability of inputs at low cost</li>
    <li>Skilled human resource at low cost</li>
    <li>Liberal labour laws</li>
    <li>To reduce the cost of transport</li>
    <li>To cater to varying tastes of customers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>GLOBALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Latest technology and distinctive competencies</li>
    <li>Technological collaboration</li>
    <li>Usage of technology by paying royalty</li>
  </ul><h1>THEORIES OF INTERNATIONALIZATION</h1>

  <h2>I. Mercantilism</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>England – Mid 16th century</li>
    <li>A country’s wealth is measured by its holdings of gold.</li>
    <li>Countries should export more than they import.</li>
    <li>Gold empowered governments to invest in armies & national institutions.</li>
    <li>Intended to benefit colonial powers.</li>
    <li>It was in the best interest of countries to maintain a trade surplus.</li>
    <li>Imports limited by tariffs; Exports subsidized.</li>
    <li>International business treated as a zero-sum game (i.e., win-loss).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>II. Absolute Advantage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adam Smith in his book “Wealth of nations”, 1776.</li>
    <li>Real wealth of a nation consists of goods & services available to its citizens, in their quality of living.</li>
    <li>Different countries produce some goods more efficiently than other countries.</li>
    <li>Global efficiency can increase through free trade.</li>
    <li>Buy V/S Build: Buy whatever you can’t produce efficiently compared to others.</li>
    <li>Such specializations will give a country a competitive advantage.</li>
    <li>National resources will shift to more efficient industries.</li>
    <li>Overall efficiency will increase due to:
      <ul>
        <li>Economies of specialization</li>
        <li>Labour time saved from job switching</li>
        <li>Economies of scale</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>III. Comparative Advantage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>David Ricardo, 1817.</li>
    <li>Global efficiency gains may still result from trade if a country specializes in those products it can produce more efficiently than other products – regardless of whether other countries can produce those same products even more efficiently.</li>
    <li>A country gains if it concentrates its resources in producing products it can produce most efficiently.</li>
    <li>Trade considered to be a positive-sum game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>IV. Heckscher – Ohlin Theory</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher & Bertil Ohlin (1991 – 1993)</li>
    <li>Patterns of international trade are determined by differences in factor endowments, rather than differences in productivity.</li>
    <li>Comparative advantage arises from the difference in national factor endowment.</li>
    <li>Factor endowments: the extent to which a country is endowed (gifted) with resources like land, labour, and capital. E.g., USA – Exporter of agricultural goods (abundance of agricultural land); China – Exporter of textiles and footwear (Abundance of low-cost labour).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>V. International Product Life Cycle Theory</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Raymond Vernon, 1996</li>
    <li>International markets tend to follow a cyclical pattern due to a variety of factors over a period of time, which explains the shifting of markets as well as the location of production.</li>
    <li>It explains the variations & reasons for change in production and consumption patterns among various markets over a time period.</li>
  </ul><h1>I. Political Environment</h1>
  <p>The political environment refers to the type of the government, the government relationship with a business, & the political risk in the country. Doing business internationally, therefore, implies dealing with a different type of government, relationships, & levels of risk.</p>
  <p>There are many different types of political systems, for example, multi-party democracies, one-party states, constitutional monarchies, dictatorships (military & non-military). Therefore, in analysing the political-legal environment, an organization may broadly consider the following aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Political system of the business;</li>
    <li>Approaches to the Government towards business i.e. Restrictive or facilitating;</li>
    <li>Facilities & incentives offered by the Government;</li>
    <li>Legal restrictions for instance licensing requirement, reservation to a specific sector like the public sector, private or small-scale sector;</li>
    <li>The Restrictions on importing technical know-how, capital goods & raw materials;</li>
    <li>The Restrictions on exporting products & services;</li>
    <li>Restrictions on pricing & distribution of goods;</li>
    <li>Procedural formalities required in setting the business.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>II. Economic Environment</h1>
  <p>The economic environment relates to all the factors that contribute to a country’s attractiveness for foreign businesses. The economic environment can be very different from one nation to another. Countries are often divided into three main categories: the more developed or industrialized, the less developed or third world, & the newly industrializing or emerging economies.</p>
  <p>Within each category, there are major variations, but overall the more developed countries are the rich countries, the less developed the poor ones, & the newly industrializing (those moving from poorer to richer). These distinctions are generally made on the basis of the gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita). Better education, infrastructure, & technology, healthcare, & so on are also often associated with higher levels of economic development.</p>
  <p>Clearly, the level of economic activity combined with education, infrastructure, & so on, as well as the degree of government control of the economy, affect virtually all facets of doing business, & a firm needs to recognize this environment if it is to operate successfully internationally. While analysing the economic environment, the organization intending to enter a particular business sector may consider the following aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An Economic system to enter the business sector.</li>
    <li>Stage of economic growth & the pace of growth.</li>
    <li>Level of national & per capita income.</li>
    <li>Incidents of taxes, both direct & indirect tax.</li>
    <li>Infrastructure facilities available & the difficulties thereof.</li>
    <li>Availability of raw materials & components & the cost thereof.</li>
    <li>Sources of financial resources & their costs.</li>
    <li>Availability of manpower-managerial, technical & workers available & their salary & wage structures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>III. Technological Environment</h1>
  <p>The technological environment comprises factors related to the materials & machines used in manufacturing goods & services. Receptivity of organizations to new technology & adoption of new technology by consumers influence decisions made in an organization.</p>
  <p>As firms do not have any control over the external environment, their success depends on how well they adapt to the external environment. An important aspect of the international business environment is the level, & acceptance, of technological innovation in different countries.</p>
  <p>In analysing the technological environment, the organization may consider the following aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Level of technological development in the country as a whole & specific business sector.</li>
    <li>The pace of technological changes & technological obsolescence.</li>
    <li>Sources of technology.</li>
    <li>Restrictions & facilities for technology transfer & time taken for the absorption of technology.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>IV. Cultural Environment</h1>
  <p>The cultural environment is one of the critical components of the international business environment & one of the most difficult to understand. This is because the cultural environment is essentially unseen; it has been described as a shared, commonly held body of general beliefs & values that determine what is right for one group, according to Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck.</p>
  <p>National culture is described as the body of general beliefs & the values that are shared by the nation. Beliefs & the values are generally seen as formed by factors such as the history, language, religion, geographic location, government, & education; thus firms begin a cultural analysis by seeking to understand these factors.</p>
  <p>The most well-known is that developed by Hofstede in1980. His model proposes four dimensions of cultural values including individualism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance & masculinity.</p>
  <p>While analysing social & cultural factors, the organization may consider the following aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approaches to society towards business in general & in specific areas;</li>
    <li>Influence of social, cultural & religious factors on the acceptability of the product;</li>
    <li>The lifestyle of people & the products used for them;</li>
    <li>Level of acceptance of, or resistance to change;</li>
    <li>Values attached to a particular product i.e. the possessive value or the functional value of the product;</li>
    <li>Demand for specific products for specific occasions;</li>
    <li>The propensity to consume & to save.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>V. Competitive Environment</h1>
  <p>The competitive environment also changes from country to country. This is partly because of the economic, political, & cultural environments; these environmental factors help determine the type & degree of competition that exists in a given country. Competition can come from a variety of sources. It can be a public or a private sector, come from large or small organizations, be domestic or global, & stem from traditional or new competitors.</p><h1>Stages of Internationalization</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>DOMESTIC OPERATIONS:</strong> The firm’s market is exclusively domestic. Most international companies have their origin as domestic companies. These companies focus on domestic operations only.<br>
      Example: Patanjali has currently its major operations in India only.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>EXPORT OPERATIONS:</strong> The firm expands its market by engaging into export operations and offering the domestic products to other countries also, but retains production facilities within domestic borders.<br>
      Example: Indian firms exporting textiles, jute, spices, nuts, rice all around the world.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT VENTURES:</strong> The firm physically moves some of its operations out of the home country. There is a mutual cost, profit sharing, and management in such method.<br>
      Example: A joint venture between Maruti (Indian Company) and Suzuki (Japanese Company).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS:</strong> The firm becomes the fully fledged multinational co.[MNC] with the assembly of production facilities in several countries & regions of the world. Some decentralization of decision making is common but many personnel decisions are still made at corporate level in headquarters.<br>
      Example: McDonald's is an MNC operating worldwide.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>TRANSNATIONAL OPERATIONS:</strong> In this, the firms that reach this particular stage are often called transnational companies because they achieve both global efficiency and local responsiveness. They use global market and resources for their functioning.<br>
      Example: Coca-Cola, Nestle
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>International Business Orientation</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Ethnocentric Orientation</strong><br>
      The practices and policies of headquarters and of the operating company in the home country become the default standard to which all subsidiaries need to comply. Such companies do not adapt their products to the needs and wants of other countries where they have operations. There are no changes in product specification, price, and promotion measures between the native market and overseas markets.<br>
      The general attitude of a company's senior management team is that nationals from the company's native country are more capable to drive international activities forward as compared to non-native employees working at its subsidiaries. The exercises, activities, and policies of the functioning company in the native country become the default standard to which all subsidiaries need to abide by.<br>
      The benefit of this mindset is that it overcomes the shortage of qualified managers in the anchoring nations by migrating them from home countries. This develops an affiliated corporate culture and aids transfer core competences more easily. The major drawback of this mindset is that it results in cultural short-sightedness and does not promote the best and brightest in a firm.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Regio centric Orientation</strong><br>
      In this approach, a company finds economic, cultural, or political similarities among regions in order to satisfy the similar needs of potential consumers. For example, countries like Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh are very similar. They possess a strong regional identity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Geocentric Orientation</strong><br>
      Geocentric approach encourages global marketing. This does not equate superiority with nationality. Irrespective of the nationality, the company tries to seek the best men and the problems are solved globally within the legal and political limits. Thus, ensuring efficient use of human resources by building strong culture and informal management channels.<br>
      The main disadvantages are that national immigration policies may put limits to its implementation and it ends up expensive compared to polycentrism. Finally, it tries to balance both global integration and local responsiveness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Polycentric Orientation</strong><br>
      In this approach, a company gives equal importance to every country’s domestic market. Every participating country is treated solely and individual strategies are carried out. This approach is especially suitable for countries with certain financial, political, and cultural constraints.<br>
      This perception mitigates the chance of cultural myopia and is often less expensive to execute when compared to ethnocentricity. This is because it does not need to send skilled managers out to maintain centralized policies. The major disadvantage of this nature is it can restrict career mobility for both local as well as foreign nationals, neglect headquarters of foreign subsidiaries and it can also bring down the chances of achieving synergy.
    </li>
